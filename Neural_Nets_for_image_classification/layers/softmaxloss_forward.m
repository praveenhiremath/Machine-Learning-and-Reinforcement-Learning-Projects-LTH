function L = softmaxloss_forward(x, labels)
    % Inputs:
    %    x - Features. See the reshape command below. It is reshaped as for
    %        the fully connected layer.
    %    labels -  It is a vector with the correct labels. For
    %        instance if we have a batch of two where the first example is
    %        class 4 and the second example is class 7, labels is [4 7].
    %
    % Outputs:
    %    L - The computed loss. You should average over the batch elements.
    %        The loss for a single example is given is the assignment. Compute
    %        that value for all elements in the batch and then average.
